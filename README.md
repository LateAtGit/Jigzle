# Jigzle
A game about jigsaw

## Background
The game is based on jigsaw tiles. There are only 18 unique and legal jigsaw tiles, every tile in a jigsaw is a rotation of one of these 18 base tiles. Jiguzle uses all those 18 tiles only once. 
There are 4 corner tiles, 8 Edge tiles and 6 internal tiles. With those tiles it's possible to build many 4x4 squared frames and then fill them with 4 of the 6 internal tiles.

## Preparation
Print the content of jigzle.png on an A4 paper and stick it on a cardboard (or better a pasteboard) and then cut tiles out.

## Solo rules

### Easy
With corners and edges build one of the possible frames and then try to fill it with the internal tiles.

### Hard
Take 4 of the 6 internal tiles and connect them in a 2x2 square and then try to build a frame around it. Not every combination of internal tiles brings to a possible solution.

### Save and share solutions
Every tile has a letter-number pair on its sides each one with a different orientation. When a solution is found it's possible to save and share it copying the top pair of each tile from top-left to bottom right.
As the same configuration can be written in 4 different ways due to the orientation, the solution should be normalized and written with the "A" tile in the top-left corner.
